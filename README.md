# universal-name-replacer
A Chrome (Manifest V3) extension that, on any website, automatically replaces every standalone occurrence of the name “kaunda uongoman” with one of four predefined nicknames (nabii, kaunda uongoman, kaongo, kasongo). In addition, it lets you add, edit, and remove arbitrary “find → replace” pairs for any other names. All replacements are applied in real time (initial page load + dynamically injected content).
